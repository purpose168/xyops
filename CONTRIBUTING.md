# Contributing to xyOps

We love open source, and we're thrilled that you want to help make **xyOps** even better!  Please read this document carefully before contributing. It explains how to work effectively with the xyOps team and where your efforts can have the biggest impact.

## Before You Open a Pull Request

We are **not currently accepting feature pull requests** (PRs), except under special circumstances.  If you have a great idea for a new feature, please:

1. [Open a GitHub Issue](https://github.com/pixlcore/xyops/issues/new) to describe your idea.  
2. Use clear and concise language, including use cases and benefits.  
3. Encourage others to give your issue a 👍 reaction.
4. Wait for a **Dev team member to approve the idea** before writing any code.

We generally prefer to design and implement new features in-house, but we're **very responsive** and regularly integrate popular feature requests quickly. Your feedback shapes the roadmap!

## Accepted Contributions

There are plenty of other valuable ways to contribute:

### Bug Fixes

- Small, well-scoped fixes are welcome.  
- Your PR should clearly describe the issue and the reasoning behind your change.  
- All unit tests must pass (`npm test`).  
- Follow our code style (see the [Development Guide](https://github.com/pixlcore/xyops/blob/main/docs/dev.md)).  
- Commits must be **signed off (DCO)** and **GPG-signed**.

### Security Issues

Please do **not** open GitHub issues for security vulnerabilities.  Instead, follow the responsible disclosure process described in our [Security Guide](https://github.com/pixlcore/xyops/blob/main/docs/security.md).

### Localization

We're preparing a formal localization process!  If you speak any languages other than English, we'd love your help translating xyOps once this is ready. Watch for updates in the GitHub Issues area.

### Plugin Development

Our biggest need right now is **Plugins**!  xyOps is built around an open plugin architecture, and we would love your contributions here.

- See the [Plugin Guide](https://github.com/pixlcore/xyops/blob/main/docs/plugins.md) for full development and publishing details.  
- Publish your plugin on GitHub, then register it on the [xyOps Plugin Marketplace](https://xyops.io/marketplace).  
- Plugins should use an **OSI-approved license** and include clear documentation of any security considerations.

### Documentation Improvements

We happily accept PRs that improve our docs!  

- All documentation lives in `/docs`.  
- Follow the writing style in the [Development Guide](https://github.com/pixlcore/xyops/blob/main/docs/dev.md).  
- Screenshots/diagrams should be **PNG** or **WebP (lossless)** with proper **alt-text**.
