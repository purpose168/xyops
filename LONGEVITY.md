# The xyOps Longevity Pledge

### TL;DR
**Always open-licensed, always OSI-approved. No rug pulls.**

### 1. Permanent Open-Source Commitment
- xyOps is, and will always remain, 100% licensed under an **OSI-approved open-source license**.
- I, **Joseph Huckaby**, founder of **PixlCore LLC**, personally guarantee that the xyOps source code will **never** be re-licensed under a closed or proprietary license, restricted in access, or split into paid editions.
- All public releases, past and future, are and will remain permanently open-licensed.
- No new "editions," "enterprise versions," or "commercial forks" will ever exist.
- The license will never be modified, split, or appended with additional restrictive terms.
- No new code or contributions will ever be accepted under a non-open license.
- No special "EE" or dual-licensed directories or files will ever exist in the xyOps codebase.

### 2. Ownership and Successor Obligations
- If PixlCore LLC is ever acquired or changes ownership, this pledge **must** transfer with it as a binding condition of sale.
- Any successor or parent company will be legally and publicly bound to honor this pledge and maintain xyOps under an OSI-approved open-source license.

### 3. Dependencies and Integrity
- All software dependencies in xyOps will always use compatible licenses (OSI-approved).
- If any dependency changes its license to an incompatible one, we will:
	1. Version-lock the last open-licensed release (already done by default), and  
	2. Replace it with an alternative or re-implement it in-house as soon as possible.

### 4. Commercial Offerings
- **xyOps Cloud** and **xyOps Enterprise** are service / support offerings only -- *not* new products or codebases.
- The xyOps software running in the cloud is the exact same open-licensed code available publicly.
- The only additions are support integrations (e.g. live chat, ticket creation), which are also open-licensed.
- There will never be paid-only features, hidden enterprise flags, or closed extensions.

### 5. Community Rights
- The xyOps source code is and always will be freely copyable and modifiable under the terms of its open-source license.
- No contributor agreement, license assignment, or other legal instrument will ever be introduced that transfers ownership of community contributions or restricts their rights.
- All contributions, past and future, remain licensed under the same open-source terms, and all contributors retain full ownership of their work while granting permission for inclusion under those terms.
- All repository history and release tags will remain publicly available in their original open-licensed form.  Past commits will never be rewritten, deleted, or hidden.

### 6. Project Stewardship
xyOps is designed not only to be open source forever, but to *endure*.  PixlCore LLC and its founder, Joseph Huckaby, are establishing safeguards to ensure that xyOps continues to exist, evolve, and remain accessible for decades to come -- regardless of individual or corporate circumstances.

#### 6a. Continuity
- All xyOps source code, documentation, and release artifacts will remain publicly accessible, and will never be taken down, hidden, or paywalled.
- The build and release process is fully automated and documented to allow anyone to reproduce official releases from source.

#### 6b. Succession Plan
- In the event that PixlCore LLC or I am no longer able to maintain xyOps, a designated successor organization (to be announced) will inherit stewardship and the full terms of this Longevity Pledge.
- All existing maintainers and community contributors will retain their rights under the open-source license, and governance continuity will be prioritized above any business considerations.

#### 6c. Community Governance
- Work is underway to formalize a **community-based governance model** that emphasizes transparency, technical merit, and inclusivity.
- The goal is to transition xyOps into a self-sustaining ecosystem -- one that can outlive any single company or individual while staying true to its founding principles of openness and fairness.

#### 6d. Sustainability
- Commercial offerings (such as xyOps Cloud) are operated independently of the open-source project and will never influence licensing or feature access.
- Funding and sponsorship opportunities will be used solely to support ongoing development, maintenance, and community growth.
- PixlCore’s future products and services will always complement, not compete with, xyOps.  We will never develop or promote a closed-source or proprietary alternative to the xyOps platform.

### 7. Closing Words
This pledge is not a marketing statement. It is a permanent promise of trust between PixlCore and the developer community.

### Meta
- This file (`LONGEVITY.md`) will always remain at the root level of the xyOps repository, alongside `LICENSE.md`.
- All releases of xyOps, including this longevity pledge, will be submitted to the [Software Heritage Foundation](https://www.softwareheritage.org).
