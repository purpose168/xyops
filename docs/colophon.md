## AI Disclosure

Artificial intelligence was used to assist development of this project, but 99.999% of the code was hand-written by a human.  Specifically, AI only assisted with:

- Documentation
- The Windows PowerShell scripts for auto-installing xySat
- The Dockerfiles and Docker Compose YAMLs
- A few CSS tricks
